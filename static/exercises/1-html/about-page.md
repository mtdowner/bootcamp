# On Your Own
Once you've finished the above work, start creating an "about" page that's all about you. In this page, include the following:

- A paragraph of information about who you are, where you live, and what you currently do for work

- Another paragraph describing what you'd like to do in web design and development
- Make a list of three important things to know about you
- Include a favorite quote, with citation for the person who said it
- Include at least one picture of yourself
- Link to a website that you like to visit frequently

If you still need more to do, make a page about some of your hobbies and activities. Include:

- What is this hobby exactly?
- How does it make you feel?
- Where have you traveled because of your hobby? What other life experiences has your hobby provided, that you might not otherwise experience?
- Photos and/or videos of your hobby in action
- Links to websites describing your hobby, or where hobbyists discuss what they do

If you manage to get as far as creating both web pages, link them together with a navigation bar.
